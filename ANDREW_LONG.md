# Virtual Piano

### April 30, 2017

### Overview
For this project, we implemented a virtual piano.
The application is interactive by allowing the users to play music using their keyboards. 
Each key corresponds to a note on the piano.

### Libraries Used
The code used two libraries:
```
(require rsound)
(require rsound/piano-tones
```

- The ```rsound``` library is used to create and play sounds. These sounds can either be built-in to the library or generated given frequencies.
- The ```rsound/piano-tones``` library is used to create sounds that resemble the actual sounds from a piano.
